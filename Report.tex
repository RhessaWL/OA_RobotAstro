\subsection*{Main project topic}
Robot astronomer â€” Build your own AI astronomer that gets 
coordinates of object AND decides what to observe.


\subsection*{Data Collections and Methods}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Stage 1: Collect data from space news sites:  \texttt{website\_scraping.ipynb}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item [$-$] Use BeautifulSoup for website scraping
            \item [$-$] Websites: https://www.space.com/science-astronomy, \\
            https://www.sciencenews.org/topic/astronomy, \\ 
            https://www.nature.com/natastron/news-and-comment, \\ 
            https://phys.org/space-news/
            \item [$-$] Get headlines and write to \texttt{headlines.txt}
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Stage 2: Process keywords \texttt{keyword\_processing.ipynb}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item [$-$] Use nltk for language and POS tagging
            \item [$-$] Find most popular topics \texttt{popular\_topics()}:
            \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
                \item[$\cdot$] Read \texttt{headlines.txt}
                \item[$\cdot$]Get nouns with nltk
                \item[$\cdot$]Write nouns in a dictionary and track count in headlines.
                \item[$\cdot$]Exclude generic words, websites, org names
                \item[$\cdot$]Get top 10 words with highest counts
                \item[$\cdot$]Write these words in \texttt{popular\_topics.txt} and their occurrences
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Stage 3: Search top topics in databases to find more information 
    about the objects and the coordinates: \texttt{object\_retrieve.ipynb}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item [$-$] Reverse search using keywords on websites
        \item [$-$] Get exact objects
        \item [$-$] Get objects' coordinates from databases, can feed object name to $https://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/dss\_form$, use Astropy
        \item [$-$] Determine if objects are observable, flag and move to next object if not observable
        \item [$-$] Use coordinates RA and Dec to get image from $https://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/dss\_form$
        \item [$-$] Save brief information about objects, coordinates, images and related news/articles
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Stage 4: Create an interface for user:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item [$-$] Display image of objects and links to papers/articles
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Project Goals}
The goal of this project is to automate the process of retrieving popular stellar objects 
from space news websites, analyzing them, and quickly determining the most popular ones to observe. 
The project aims to achieve this goal by utilizing advanced techniques in AI and automation.\\

The first objective of the project is to develop a web scraping tool that can 
crawl popular space news websites and retrieve articles related to stellar objects. 
The tool will then use natural language processing techniques to identify and extract 
the names of the stellar objects mentioned in the articles.\\

The second objective is to analyze the data collected by the web scraping tool 
to determine the most popular stellar objects among the articles retrieved. This 
will be achieved by using natural language processing to tag keywords mentioned 
in headlines to process the data and identify most mentioned objects in the articles.\\

The third objective is to search for the popular stellar objects identified in 
the second objective within the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) database 
using regular expression names. The tool will retrieve the  International 
Celestial Reference System (ICRS) coordinates of the objects, their images, 
and related articles/research papers from the STScI database.\\

The final objective is to present the data retrieved in a user-friendly interface 
that allows astronomers to quickly identify the most popular and promising stellar 
objects to observe. The interface will provide users with a dashboard that displays 
the ICRS coordinates, images, and related articles/research papers of the popular stellar objects.\\

Overall, the project aims to streamline the process of identifying and observing 
popular stellar objects by automating the data retrieval and analysis process. 
By achieving these objectives, the project will enable astronomers to make more 
efficient use of their time and resources, and increase the likelihood of making 
groundbreaking discoveries in the field of astronomy.\\

\subsection*{Background}
The field of astronomy has been revolutionized by advances in Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) and automation. These technologies have greatly improved our ability to collect 
and analyze vast amounts of astronomical data, and have enabled us to make significant 
discoveries about the universe.\\

One of the primary applications of AI and automation in astronomy is in the collection 
of data. With the development of advanced telescopes and sensors, astronomers can now 
capture vast amounts of data about the universe. However, processing and analyzing 
this data manually can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. AI and automation 
have therefore been used to streamline the data collection process, allowing astronomers 
to gather more data in less time. In addition to collecting data, AI and automation have 
also been used to identify and select objects of interest for further observation. 
This is particularly important in astronomy, where there are billions of stars and 
other celestial objects to observe. By using AI algorithms to analyze the data collected 
by telescopes and sensors, astronomers can quickly identify objects that are most likely 
to yield valuable scientific insights.\\

Auto-selecting stellar objects to observe has become an important aspect of modern 
astronomy. AI and automation have made this process more efficient by enabling astronomers 
to quickly identify objects that they are interested in, allowing them to focus their 
attention and resources on the most promising objects.\\
