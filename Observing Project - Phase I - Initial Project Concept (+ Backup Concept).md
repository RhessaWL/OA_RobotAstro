### Main project topic, research question or idea:

Robot astronomer — Build your own AI astronomer that controls a telescope AND decides what to observe.

#### Possible data to be collected or planned methods  

-   Can train AI to search for the newest Astro news, locate the object of interest, and point to that coordinates.
    
-   Integrate with Stellarium?
    
-   Integrate with the language library to search for Aatro news/topics
    
-   Geo API's.
    

#### Questions/uncertainties about the project:

-   How we can connect the program to the telescope, I’m a software person, I don’t have much experience with hardware.
    
-   Do we have to get hardware?
    
-   Can we contribute to open source Robotic control system or do we have to build from scratch?
    

### Back-up :

Data mining in Astronomy: Use Deep Learning techniques to classify exoplanets.

#### Possible data to be collected or planned methods  

-   Kaggle, NASA Archives.
    
-   [https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/](https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/)
    
-   https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/
    

#### Questions/uncertainties about project:

-   Where to find unprocessed data of Exoplanet candidates
    
-   Could there be another way to classify an exoplanet other than looking at its disposition?
